### 3.2 Jumpers 

---

**Just like the F6 V1.4, the two Z-motor sockets are changed from parallel to series. If you only use one of the sockets, the other must be connected with a jumper cap, otherwise a Z-axis motor will not work.**

![1574491030269](images/S6_1574491030269.png)



#### 3.2.1 Stepper drivers

In order to support as many different drivers as possible, S6 sets a lot of jumper positions. Different drive modules require different jumpers. As shown in the schematic diagram, there are 2 sets of jumpers in the drive section: JP1 and  JP6. 

![1574475839586](images/S6_1574475839586.png)

In order to give you a better understanding of how to use jumpers for different drivers, I have further illustrated the driver socket. The basic definition of the driver pins is the same, the difference lies in the four places of JP6-1, JP6-2, JP6-3 and JP6-4. You can see their role from the schematic.

![1574476699891](images/S6_1574476699891.png)





##### A4988 jumper config

![1574477723736](images/S6_1574477723736.png)

- For A4988, A4988 similar, TMC2100 and TMC standalone Mode,  You need jumper JP6 (1234-5678) to config the micro-steps, and some TMC features.
- When you connect the jumper cap, this pin is high. When you are not connected, it is the level state of the module itself. This is different from F6, which can be either high or low.
- For details, please refer to the corresponding driver description.

##### UART mode config

![1574477819491](images/S6_1574477819491.png)

- For TMC2208/2225/2209. You just need one jumper to close the JP1, Then the UART mode will enabled.
- You can config all the feature of  the TMC chip via UART, so you can leave all the other jumpers empty.
- Even for 2209, We give 2 lines UART interface to every driver, so no need config the address by MS1/MS2.

###### TMC2209 wiring

![](images/TMC2209.JPG)

##### SPI mode config

![1574477946366](images/S6_1574477946366.png)

- For TMC2130/5160/5161. You need 4 jumpers to close the JP6, Then the SPI mode will enabled.

#### 3.2.2 12V/24V jumpers

![1574476322618](images/S6_1574476322618.png)



- S6 have 12V onboard, Fan and RGB jumpers can refer to this picture and the silk screen at the bottom of the board.
- The input power supply voltage should EXCEED 15v ,if not, the output voltage of 12V DCDC circuit will lower than 12v
- Never let the 12V current exceed 5A, otherwise it will burn out the 12V DCDC circuit.
- If you use an input above 18V, you will get a satisfactory 12V output, otherwise the output may be less than 12V.

#### 3.2.3 DIAG jumpers

![1574476382401](images/S6_1574476382401.png)

- If you use a TMC driver with sensor-less homing(2130/2209/5160/5161), you can connect these jumpers so that the MCU can get the DIAG signal through the corresponding end-stop pin to achieve sensor-less.
- After connect the jumper, remember define the DIAG pins in the firmware and enable the feature.

#### 3.2.4 Bottom jumpers

![1574476497110](images/S6_1574476497110.png)

- X+ / Y+ / Z+ , You can choose 5V or 3.3V, For X+ & Y+, the default is 3.3V. For Z+, The default is 5V, You can connect BLtouch here.

- X- / Y- / Z- , You can choose 24V or 3.3V, the default is 3.3V. You can switch to 24V, if you want to use some inductive or capacitive sensors.

  ![1574476533464](images/S6_1574476533464.png)

- I2C pins, You can choose 5V or 3.3V, the default is 3.3V. 

- For TE0-TE2, You can cut the jumper if you want use a thermocouple temperature measurement through AD597.

#### 3.2.5 Jumper for 5V

S6 **V2.0** version adds 5V selection jumper. You can choose 5V from USB or DC circuit. 

Know issue: With 5V USB jumper selected, 24V applied, USB cable disconnected, the heater FETs will turn on.  So we recommend you to choose 5v from DC5V.

![S6跳线-5V](images/S6跳线-5V.png)

#### 3.2.6 Jumper for Boot0

In S6 V2.0, the BOOT0 button is replaced by a jumper.

![S6V2.0BOOT0](images/S6V2.0BOOT0.png)

### 3.3 Pin Definition

All the pins we have marked on the back of the board, if you need to, you can confirm the board in reverse or check the sch.

Thanks to the power of the STM32, each pin has multiple functions, I will identify it for your reference as much as possible. For further information, please refer to the STM32F446 datasheet, which I have placed on our [S6 GitHub](https://github.com/FYSETC/FYSETC-S6/blob/master/datasheet/stm32f446ve.pdf)

#### 3.3.1 EXP1&EXP2

![1574483263718](images/S6_1574483263718.png)



#### 3.3.2 Eedstops and UART1 Pins

The UART socket next to the limit switch can be used to connect serial devices such as the wifi module, or to update the firmware through the serial port.

### 4.2 Klipper

You need to follow the Klipper [installation guide](https://www.klipper3d.org/Installation.html) to install [Klipper](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper).

When calling `make menuconfig`, please select below options

#### 4.2.1 menuconfig

- #### Enable `extra low-level configuration options`

- #### Micro-controller Architecture

Select `STMicroelectronics STM32`

- #### Processor model

Select `STM32F446`

- #### Clock reference

Select `12 MHz crystal`

- #### Bootloader offset

- ##### 1. Boot address no


If you choose `No bootloader` bootloader offset in Klipper `make menuconfig`, then you use DFU([method1](#jump4) [method2](#jump)) to upload the firmware to S6 board. **But you need to set the 'Start address' to `0x08000000`**. 

![image-20210705151440643](images/menuconfig1.png)

- ##### 2. Boot address 32k


If you choose `32k` bootloader offset in Klipper `make menuconfig`. Then you need to flash the S6 board bootloader named `Bootloader_FYSETC_S6` first (If you get your S6 board after `2021/06/23`, no worries, the bootloader is on the board when it leave the factory). The bootloader is in the folder named `bootloader` in this repo, please follow the README in bootloader folder([github](https://github.com/FYSETC/FYSETC-S6/tree/main/bootloader) or [gitee](https://gitee.com/fysetc/FYSETC-S6/tree/main/bootloader)). Then you can follow [Upload the firmware(SDCARD)](#jump1) to flash your built Klipper firmware to S6. Or you can use DFU([method1](#jump4) [method2](#jump)) to upload your firmware, but **remember to change flash address to `0x08008000`** with these two methods. 

![image-20210705151337765](images/menuconfig2.png)

- ##### 3. Boot address 64k


If you choose `64k` bootloader offset in Klipper `make menuconfig`. Then you need to flash the S6 board bootloader named `Bootloader_FYSETC_S6_10000` first. The bootloader is in the folder named `bootloader` in this repo, please follow the README in bootloader folder([github](https://github.com/FYSETC/FYSETC-S6/tree/main/bootloader) or [gitee](https://gitee.com/fysetc/FYSETC-S6/tree/main/bootloader)). Then you can follow [Upload the firmware(SDCARD)](#jump1) to flash your built Klipper firmware to S6. Or you can use DFU([method1](#jump4) [method2](#jump)) to upload your firmware, but **remember to change flash address to `0x08010000`** with these two methods. 

![image-20210705151951142](images/menuconfig3.png)

#### 4.2.2 Compile firmware

```
make
```

#### 4.2.3 Upload firmware

Follow Firmware Update guide [here](#jump0).

### 4.3 Upload firmware

#### 4.3.1 Upload the firmware(SDCARD)

We provide several ways to upload the firmware .Uploading with SD card is our default way to update the firmware as the board already has the sdcard bootloader in it when it leave the factory. If you choose to upload the firmware with a sdcard. First you need to connect a sdcard module to the S6 EXP2 port. Basically , you can use any kind of LCD screen(like our [mini12864](https://github.com/FYSETC/FYSETC-Mini-12864-Panel)) that contain sdcard module. But if you can't make it work , check if your sdcard module's SPI CS pin connected to PA4 pin in S6 board.

Then,copy your compiled firmware file ```firmware.bin``` file to the SD card , and insert it to the SD card module , and then power on the board. You may need to wait for about 30s to finish uploading. 

Note: The bootloader is in the folder named `bootloader`, please follow the README in [bootloader folder](https://github.com/FYSETC/FYSETC-S6/tree/main/bootloader).

#### 4.3.2 <span id="jump4">Upload the firmware(dfu-util)</span>

This method works in linux, that means should work in raspberry pi.

1. Enter DFU mode first

   - First power off the board
   - Set jumper on 5v pin and DC5V ![](images/5vJumper.png)
   - Place jumper on BT0 to 3.3V pin ![](images/boot.png)
   - Connect USB cable to the board and your computer 
   - Power up the board with 24v 

2. Make sure dfu-util is installed, shoot `dfu-util --version` command to check.

   Sample output:

   ```
   dfu-util 0.9
   
   Copyright 2005-2009 Weston Schmidt, Harald Welte and OpenMoko Inc.
   Copyright 2010-2016 Tormod Volden and Stefan Schmidt
   This program is Free Software and has ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY
   Please report bugs to http://sourceforge.net/p/dfu-util/tickets/
   ```

   If not , you should install it first, use the package manager of your distribution to get the latest version, like

   ```
   sudo apt-get install dfu-util
   ```

3. Then use the command below to upload the firmware. You should replace `firmware.bin` below with your built firmware bin file location like `out/klipper.bin` if you use klipper firmware. Change flash address `0x08008000` to bootloader you choosed. (If you use Marlin and your platformio env is `default_envs = FYSETC_S6`, then you need to set it to `0x08010000` and you need bootloader , if you use klipper firmware and you choose boot address `32kiB bootloader` when compiling klipper then set it `0x08008000`, if `64kiB bootloader` , set it `0x08010000`. if `no bootloader` set it to `0x08000000`)

   ```
   dfu-util -R -a 0 -s 0x08008000:leave -D firmware.bin
   ```

#### 4.3.3 <span id="jump">Upload the firmware(DFU)</span>

The other way to upload the firmware is using DFU. 

##### Step 1. Download stm32cubeprogrammer 

You can download it from ST website.

https://www.st.com/zh/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html

Open the STM32CubeProgrammer software.

![1574332767079](images/S6_1574332767079.png)

##### Step 2. Enter DFU mode

S6 v1.2

First power off the board , then push the Boot0 button and hold it , then connect the USB to the board and your computer , it will enter DFU mode . Now you can loose you hand from Boot0 button.

S6 v2.x

First power off the board , then jumper the Boot0 to 3.3V , then connect the USB to the board and your computer , it will enter DFU mode . 

***REMEMBER to remove the jumper if you finish uploading or it will enter DFU mode again.***

##### Step 3. Upload the firmware

Now you can connect and flash the S6 board with stm32cubeprogrammer with the following operation.

![1574386395071](images/S6_1574386395071.png)

Do as the red number shows in the screen shot.

1. Click the button to flesh the DFU port.

2. Connect the DFU 

3. Choose the "firmware.bin" file.

4. fill in the 'Start address' with `0x8008000` (If you use Marlin firmware and your platformio env is `default_envs = FYSETC_S6`, then you need to set it to `0x08010000`, if env is `default_envs = FYSETC_S6_8000`, then you need to set it to `0x08008000` . If you use klipper firmware and you choose boot address `32kiB bootloader` when compiling klipper then set it `0x08008000`, if `64kiB bootloader` , set it `0x08010000`. if `no bootloader` set it to `0x08000000`)

5. Start Programming

**We will continue to update, please look forward to it!**
